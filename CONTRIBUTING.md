# Contributing to LOUDR

Hey there, fellow dev or curious soul! üëã

First off ‚Äî **thanks for dropping by.** LOUDR isn‚Äôt some corporate thing. It‚Äôs a passion project I built out of pure frustration and fun (read the [README](./README.md) for the juicy backstory). But hey, if something about it inspires you to contribute ‚Äî I respect that big time.

## Ground Rules

- **Be chill.** This isn‚Äôt Google. Keep things friendly and real.
- **Open issues first.** Got a bug or feature in mind? File an issue before submitting a PR, so we can chat.
- **Small commits = better commits.** If you're contributing code, keep the changes tidy and focused.
- **No drama.** Just vibes. Seriously.

## Tech Stack

- Built with [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TypeScript all the way
- Firefox-first mindset

## What You Can Do

- Suggest features (even wild ones)
- Fix bugs (if you somehow find one in this tiny beast)
- Improve the UI or UX
- Polish the README or docs
